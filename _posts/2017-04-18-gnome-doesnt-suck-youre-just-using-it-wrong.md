title: GNOME Doesn’t Suck, You’re Just Using It Wrong
---

(I know, click-bait title, couldn't resist.)

Ever since Ubuntu announced that they're [switching to GNOME][0] as 
their default desktop environment, online discussions about it have 
exploded. I thought this extra publicity would do GNOME good but the 
most frequent comments I see are 'the default settings _suck_, they 
should be this way' or 'why don't they add `x`, it's so obvious!', and 
of course 'GNOME is focused on touch, that's why it sucks'. Please let 
me clear things up a little.

I feel ya
---------

The best way I can explain it is with my own journey.

When I first tried Linux I came into a world where everything was different to
what I had known for years. But instead of trying to turn it back to something
familiar I took it all in the way it was and found sense in it, because I saw
it was much better. That was Unity mind you.

However my laptop had a single core and 750MB of RAM so it soon became apparent
that I would have to try something lighter. LXDE, Xfce, LXQt, you name it.
However these DEs often came with pretty painful defaults. That's when I became
a _tweaker_. I spent hours experimenting with setups, constantly switching
workflows, trying to find the perfect one.

When I finally bought more RAM and installed GNOME, which I really wanted to
try after I experienced Gedit with HeaderBars. However, this time it was
different. I became used to the fact that in order to get a working desktop, I
had to build it myself. I saw people with similar opinions complaining how
GNOME just cannot set sane defaults---and I came in prepared.

As soon as the GNOME Shell launched I touched every setting I could. I changed
the theme (ugh so white, so big!), installed all the extensions (why does the
dock keep hiding? Who thought that was a good idea?), even changed the font
(Ubuntu FTW!).

(Funnily a few hours after that I found out how `rm` is powerful and cleaned my
entire home directory by accident. I had enough of tweaking so I only re-did
the most important things, but it still changed the GNOME experience entirely.)

Paradigm Shift™
---------------

As I met more GNOME guys, I found out that there was actually carefully
though-out work behind all the questionable design choices. I saw setups where
the minimise/maximise buttons weren't enabled (whaaat?). I saw people not using
a dock, keeping the theme. And I tried it. I slowly changed settings back to
defaults, even the wallpaper, and tried to live with it.

And I realised a lot of things, _exempli gratia_:

 * the default un-tweaked `Alt+Tab`is actually much better than having a 
   dock
 * dynamic workspaces are quite good for organising stuff, and that 
   I don't need to name them/set default workspaces for apps to stay 
   organised
 * I really do not need to minimise windows, and for that one time that 
   is useful I can just use `Super+H`
 * the default theme, even though it took me quite some time  to accept 
   the look (which I later grew to love so much I ported it to GTK+
   2), is much more functional than the others (by that I mean it 
   doesn't prefer looks over other values), has much better contrast, is 
   much better supported and the bigger paddings are make it much nicer 
   to use, especially on non-mouse inputs
 * searching is a really fast way to do stuff
 * keyboard shortcuts are powerful enough for a keyboard-centric
   workflow

What has all of this got to do with me?
---------------------------------------

The thing I'm trying to say is that GNOME isn't an empty plate---it's an
extremely well thought out system meant to be used by anyone, where everything
fits together. If you're going to use GNOME thinking that your way is much
better than the way thought up by the designers---people whose entire job is to
make it as good as possible---your experience will be frustrating and you'll be
essentially banging your head against a wall.

But if you come with an open mind, as a student and not a teacher, you'll find
that it actually has something to it, and maybe you'll even like it.

So, I hereby **challenge you**, the reader, to use GNOME, **as pure as you
can**, as your main desktop environment for at least two weeks. If you still
don't see the point after that, you are free to complain about it as much as
you want. Until you do so however, your right to complain is about as big as
complaining that your tooth brush sucks at brushing hair.

Footnote
--------

GNOME isn't perfect, or for everyone (shock! But seriously, people just 
prefer different workflows and that's fine), and I'm not saying that.  
There are plenty of things either awaiting design or implementation, 
things that need to be redone (as is being done with almost the whole of 
the control center) or things that people need persuading for 
(destructive middle-click anyone?). But there's always room for new 
contributors with tons of friendly people happy to get you started.

If you've read it this far, uh, thanks, I didn't really expect that. If you
think I'm wrong feel free to leave a comment, I'll try to answer as soon as I
can. Stay hip!
