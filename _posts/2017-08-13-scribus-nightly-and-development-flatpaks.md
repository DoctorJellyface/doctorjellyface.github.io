title: Scribus Nightly & Development are Now Available as Flatpaks
---

**Update:** Scribus is now available on [Flathub][7]; the nightlies are
currently unmaintained.

You heard it. Getting the latest Scribus is now as easy as clicking this
[link][0]. (Of course, you need Flatpak [installed][1].)

Or if the git-y bleeding edge isn’t your thing, then click this [link][2] (if
you get a 404 don’t worry, it’ll be up in a couple of hours) for the more
stable development version, currently at 1.5.3, which, apart from lacking the
scary red warning text in the splash screen, also manages to tuck in OTF
support for all that flfi-ing, small caps and proportional oldstyle goodness,
and a myriad of other probably more important [changes][3].

I won’t keep this blog post updated, however, so **probably a better idea is to
head [here][4]** for the instructions.

Note that the nightly won’t be a nightly per se, more of a weekly, because my
Thinkpad X220 and 50KB/s upload only handle that much.

As always, contributions, of any kind, welcome, and please report any bugs you
may find either on the scribus-flatpak [GitHub page][5] or [upstream][6].
Cheers!
