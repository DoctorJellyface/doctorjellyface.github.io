I try to be busy around the open-source world:

 * I'm a member of the [GNOME Foundation][1] and I try to be active
   around GNOME. I currently maintain the [`gnome-settings-standard`][2] 
   module
 * I maintain several packages in the [AUR][3] and I occasionally write 
   stuff I learn into the [Arch Wiki][4]
 * I'm quite involved in reporting bugs in a lot of projects, not sure 
   if that's noteworthy but I do spend a lot of time doing so

When I was younger I spent a lot of time in game-dev, you can see the 
remnants of it in my [old blog][5].
